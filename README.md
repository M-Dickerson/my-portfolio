# My Portfolio
## Description

The motivation and purpose of this project was to create a base for a usable portfolio. It solves the problem of not having a hub to showcase my best work. I learned a lot about properly using flexbox, as well as building a site from scratch and making everything function properly. I also learned how to use media controls to make a desktop site accessable on smaller screens.
